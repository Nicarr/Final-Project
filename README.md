Utilized libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
Developed functions for analyzing contract data and extracting insights.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.
Integrated Seaborn for advanced statistical visualizations.
Machine Learning Implementation
Applied data preprocessing techniques using OneHotEncoder.
Developed and trained predictive models using LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, and KNeighborsClassifier.
Optimized model performance using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
